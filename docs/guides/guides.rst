Below are some practical guides for tasks that we hope Zoobot will be helpful for.

If you'd prefer worked examples, you can find those under `zoobot/pytorch/examples <https://github.com/mwalmsley/zoobot/blob/main/zoobot/pytorch/examples>`_ and `zoobot/tensorflow/examples <https://github.com/mwalmsley/zoobot/blob/main/zoobot/tensorflow/examples>`_. 

There's also this `Colab notebook <https://colab.research.google.com/drive/17bb_KbA2J6yrIm4p4Ue_lEBHMNC1I9Jd?usp=sharing>`_ demonstrating finetuning which you can run in the cloud (with free access to a powerful GPU, courtesy of Google Research)
